# Advent of code 2024
My solution to the advent of code 2024. I wanted to challenge myself by doing this project in deno (never done that before) and by doing everyday in 2 parts: first I'll try to solve it myself, with the best solution I can come up with and then ask AI to rewrite/write its best version of the problem so that I can compare them and learn from it!

## How to run
You can run any day by just running the command
```
deno run advent <number of the day> <ai/human>
```
Example: ```deno run advent 1 human``` will run day one of the advent of code.
